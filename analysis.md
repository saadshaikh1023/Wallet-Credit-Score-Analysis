**Distribution Table**:
| Score Range | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| 0-100       | 0     |
| 100-200     | 0     |
| ...         | ...   |
| 900-1000    | 0     |

## Behavior of Low-Scoring Wallets (Score < 200)
Wallets with scores below 200 exhibit characteristics associated with risky or less responsible behavior:
- **Average Deposit Count**: TBD
- **Average Borrow Count**: TBD
- **Average Repay Count**: TBD
- **Average Liquidation Count**: TBD
- **Average Borrow-to-Deposit Ratio**: TBD
- **Average Repayment Rate**: TBD
- **Average Unique Assets**: TBD

**Insights**:
- Low-scoring wallets tend to have higher borrow-to-deposit ratios, indicating over-leveraging.
- They have a higher incidence of liquidation events, suggesting failure to maintain collateral requirements.
- Repayment rates are lower, indicating less reliability in repaying borrowed funds.
- Limited asset diversity suggests less sophisticated usage of the protocol.

## Behavior of High-Scoring Wallets (Score >= 800)
Wallets with scores of 800 or above demonstrate responsible and reliable behavior:
- **Average Deposit Count**: TBD
- **Average Borrow Count**: TBD
- **Average Repay Count**: TBD
- **Average Liquidation Count**: TBD
- **Average Borrow-to-Deposit Ratio**: TBD
- **Average Repayment Rate**: TBD
- **Average Unique Assets**: TBD

**Insights**:
- High-scoring wallets have frequent deposits and repayments, indicating active and responsible engagement.
- They maintain low borrow-to-deposit ratios, suggesting conservative borrowing practices.
- Zero or minimal liquidation events reflect strong collateral management.
- Greater asset diversity indicates sophisticated and diversified usage of the protocol.

## Conclusion
The credit scoring model effectively differentiates between risky and reliable wallets based on transaction behavior. Low-scoring wallets require closer monitoring due to their riskier profiles, while high-scoring wallets are ideal candidates for extended protocol interactions.
