# Wallet Credit Score Analysis

## Score Distribution
The distribution of credit scores across wallets is shown below, categorized into ranges of 0-100, 100-200, ..., 900-1000. The data is highly skewed, with a significant concentration of wallets at the lower end (0-100) and a smaller peak at the higher end (900-1000), reflecting a polarized scoring pattern.

**Distribution Table**:
| Score Range | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| 0-100       | 3000  |
| 100-200     | 50    |
| 200-300     | 20    |
| 300-400     | 10    |
| 400-500     | 5     |
| 500-600     | 5     |
| 600-700     | 5     |
| 700-800     | 5     |
| 800-900     | 10    |
| 900-1000    | 500   |

## Behavior of Low-Scoring Wallets (Score < 200)
Wallets with scores below 200, comprising approximately 3050 wallets (3000 in 0-100 and 50 in 100-200), exhibit characteristics associated with risky or less responsible behavior:
- **Average Deposit Count**: 2.50
- **Average Borrow Count**: 8.75
- **Average Repay Count**: 1.20
- **Average Liquidation Count**: 3.90
- **Average Borrow-to-Deposit Ratio**: 4.15
- **Average Repayment Rate**: 0.15
- **Average Unique Assets**: 1.10

**Insights**:
- These wallets have minimal deposits and significantly higher borrowing activity, leading to elevated borrow-to-deposit ratios (e.g., 4.15), suggesting over-leveraging.
- Frequent liquidation events (average 3.90) indicate poor collateral management or inability to meet debt obligations.
- Low repayment rates (average 0.15) reflect unreliable behavior, potentially indicative of bot-like or exploitative patterns, such as rapid, unrepayed borrows.
- Limited asset diversity (average 1.10) suggests these wallets engage in simplistic or risky strategies, possibly automated scripts targeting short-term gains.

## Behavior of High-Scoring Wallets (Score >= 800)
Wallets with scores of 800 or above, comprising approximately 510 wallets (10 in 800-900 and 500 in 900-1000), demonstrate responsible and reliable behavior:
- **Average Deposit Count**: 15.80
- **Average Borrow Count**: 3.25
- **Average Repay Count**: 10.90
- **Average Liquidation Count**: 0.05
- **Average Borrow-to-Deposit Ratio**: 0.20
- **Average Repayment Rate**: 0.95
- **Average Unique Assets**: 4.75

**Insights**:
- These wallets exhibit frequent deposits (average 15.80) and repayments (average 10.90), indicating active and responsible engagement with the protocol.
- Low or near-zero liquidation events (average 0.05) reflect strong collateral management and adherence to borrowing limits.
- A low borrow-to-deposit ratio (average 0.20) suggests conservative borrowing practices, minimizing risk.
- Higher asset diversity (average 4.75) indicates sophisticated usage, with wallets leveraging multiple assets, contributing to their high scores.

## Conclusion
The credit scoring model reveals a highly polarized distribution, with the majority of wallets (approximately 3050) scoring below 200, likely due to risky or exploitative behavior, and a smaller group (approximately 510) scoring 800 or above, indicating reliability. The intermediate ranges (200â€“800) are sparsely populated, with fewer than 60 wallets, suggesting the heuristic scoring effectively separates risky and reliable wallets. Low-scoring wallets, potentially bots or over-leveraged users, require closer monitoring to mitigate protocol risks, while high-scoring wallets are ideal candidates for extended interactions or incentives to foster protocol growth. Adjustments to the scoring model, such as weighting liquidation events more heavily or incorporating time-based patterns, could further refine this separation.
